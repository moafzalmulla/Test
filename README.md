# Test
Code for Havas people

Index.html : 

Provides responsive columnar grid, without using any frameworks.
Custom media queries have been written,
In my previous experience - this will show best on ie8 if I was allowed to use something like : https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond
Respond.js allows ie6 to ie8 to understand media queries.

Flicker.html : 

A feed that pulls in pictures from Flickr using the tag "London",
Users can also toggle select images by double clicking the ones they like.

PS. I have done css on page for the excercise, but in an ideal world I will package and minify both css and js in separate locations.  Also to speed up the process I would use frameworks suchs ase Bootstrap / Webflow / Material CSS to generate responsive grids etc.

Thanks you
